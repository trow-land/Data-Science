  - Presence of currency symbols (`â‚¹`) in price columns.
  - Inconsistent or missing values in certain columns.
  - Potential duplicates in product or review data.

- **Steps Taken**:
  - Removed currency symbols and converted prices to numeric.
  - Cleaned `discount_percentage` and `rating_count` columns for accurate analysis.
  - Dropped or imputed missing values where necessary.

Python script used for cleaning: [data_cleaning.py](link-to-your-script).
