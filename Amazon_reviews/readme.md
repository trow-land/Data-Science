## **Introduction**

The dataset provides a detailed view of Amazon sales, including product information, pricing, discounts, ratings, and reviews. This project demonstrates the use of SQL for data extraction and Python for preprocessing, combined with BI tools for visualisation.

## **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

- **Issues Identified**:
  - Presence of currency symbols (`â‚¹`) in price columns.
  - Inconsistent or missing values in certain columns.
  - Duplicates in product or review data.
  - Changes columns datatypes

- **Steps Taken**:
  - Removed currency symbols and converted prices to numeric.
  - Added additional 'main_category' and 'item' columns
  - Dropped duplicates

Python script used for cleaning: [data_cleaning.py](link-to-your-script).
The resulting dataset contains 1348 rows of data.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI**: For data visualisation and analysis.
- **PostgreSQL**: For SQL-based data manipulation.
- **Python**: For initial preprocessing.

## Key Insights

1. **Dataset Category Distribution**:
    - Dataset can be split into 9 main categories:
    - The dataset is heavily weighted towards electronic items, home and kitchen, and computers/computer accessories.

2. **Most Reviewed Items**:
    - The most reviewed items in this dataset are shown below:

3. **Top Reviewed items and categories**:
    - The highest reviewed items (4.6/5) were Tablets, in the computers&accessories category.
    - The top performin category was office products, followed by toys and games.
    - With the dataset so heavily weighted towards specific categories this comparison could be easily skewed with an individual item. Three of the categories only had 1 item.

4. **Worst rated items**:
    - The worst rated items were Electric grinders, dust covers and PC Headsets scoring 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 respectively.

5. **Distribution of Discounts**:
   - Majority of products fall within the 40-60% discount range.
   - A distinct spike at 0% discounts.

6. **Relationship Between Discounts and Ratings**:
   - There is a slight negative correlation between discount percentage and ratings.
