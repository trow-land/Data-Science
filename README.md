### **2. Heart Disease Prediction**  
- **Overview**: â€¢	Performed exploratory data analysis to identify key risk factors and correlations in heart disease data to build and evaluated machine learning models, with Logiistic achieving and F1 score of 85% in heart disease classification.
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Identified health attributes that strongly correlate to heart disease.  
  - Explored how feature distributions changed between genders.  
  - Compared several ML models to perform binary classification to predict the presence of heart disease.
