## Past Projects

### **1. TFL Cycling Journeys Analysis**  
- **Overview**: Explored Transport for London cycling data using SQL and PostgreSQL to calculate direct distances between start and end stations using the Haversine formula.  
- **Tools**: PostgreSQL, SQL, PostGIS (optional), Python.  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Performed spatial joins using station metadata.  
  - Used trigonometric distance calculations to estimate journey lengths.  
  - Demonstrated how to avoid repeating complex expressions in SQL `WHERE` clauses using subqueries.

### **3. Heart Disease Prediction**  
- **Overview**: Performed exploratory data analysis to identify key risk factors and correlations in heart disease data. Built and evaluated machine learning models, with Logistic Regression achieving an F1 score of 85% in classification.  
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Identified health attributes that strongly correlate to heart disease.  
  - Explored how feature distributions changed between genders.  
  - Compared several ML models for binary classification.

### **4. News Article Highlights Summarisation**  
- **Overview**: Fine-tuned a pre-trained BART model to summarise news articles from the CNN and DailyMail dataset, generating concise highlights from lengthy text inputs.  
- **Tools**: Python, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, ROUGE Evaluation.  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Achieved moderate ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1: 0.3557, ROUGE-2: 0.1579).  
  - Fine-tuned BART with optimised token lengths for long inputs.  
  - Demonstrated effective summarisation capabilities.
