Types of A&E service are

Type 1 A&E department = A consultant led 24-hour service with full resuscitation facilities and designated accommodation for the reception of accident and emergency patients.
Type 2 A&E department = A consultant led single specialty accident and emergency service (e.g. ophthalmology, dental) with designated accommodation for the reception of patients.
Type 3 A&E department / Type 4 A&E department / Urgent Care Centre = Other type of A&E/Urgent Treatment Centre (UTCs)/ Minor Injury Units (MIUs)/Walk-in Centres (WiCs)/Urgent Care Centre, primarily designed for the receiving of accident and emergency patients. A Type 3 department may be doctor led or nurse led. It may be co-located with a major A&E or sited in the community. A defining characteristic of a service qualifying as a Type 3 department is that it treats at least minor injuries and illnesses (sprains for example) and can be routinely accessed without an appointment. From December 2019 the majority of Type 3 and Type 4 services will be designated as GP-led UTCs or will change their function to become other primary health care services, with any exemptions to be agreed with the Regional Director.
